# Sorting Hat
This project continues the progression from [the previous week's](https://github.com/atphy/pet-adoption) and adds several layers of complexity. Cards are generated for "students" from a user's input and then sorted in to one of four groups. The user can "expel" students, which sends them to another section on the page. In addition to the technical skills, I was finally forced to learn about Harry Potter for this project!
